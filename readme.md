# Remotely on Traefik

This is a example for how to use Remotely with Traefik as a reverse proxy.

## Remotely does not support this configuration

To be clear Remotely only supports using caddy as a reverse proxy. This is completely unsupported configuration by the project.
I am providing this as a reference for those who want to use Traefik as a reverse proxy, without support from the project.
